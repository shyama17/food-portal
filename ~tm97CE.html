<p ccID="203">The cuisine of the United States reflects its history. The European colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.

<img ccID="1031" src="download (2).jpg" align="right">
<p ccID="1075">During the Progressive Era (1890s–1920s) food production and presentation became more industrialized. Major railroads featured upscale cuisine in their dining cars.[23] Restaurant chains emerged with standardized decor and menus, most famously the Fred Harvey restaurants along the route of the Sante Fe Railroad in the Southwest.[24]

At the universities, nutritionists and home economists taught a new scientific approach to food. During World War I the Progressives' moral advice about food conservation was emphasized in large-scale state and federal programs designed to educate housewives. Large-scale foreign aid during and after the war brought American standards to Europe.[25]

Newspapers and magazines ran recipe columns, aided by research from corporate kitchens, which were major food manufactures like General Mills, Campbell's, and Kraft Foods. One characteristic of American cooking is the fusion of multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking styles. For example, spaghetti is Italian, while hot dogs are German; a popular meal, especially among young children, is spaghetti containing slices of hot dogs. The fact that most Americans don't really even see this as a fusion recipe shows just how common this trend is. Since the 1960s Asian cooking has played a particularly large role in American fusion cuisine</p>

Sandwich breads are produced in many varieties, such as white, whole wheat, sourdough, rye, multigrain[1][5][6][7] and others. Sandwich bread may be formulated to slice easily,[8] cleanly or uniformly, and may have a fine crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a light texture.[4] Sandwich bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness.

<li ccID="3142"><b ccID="3146">Cheeses</b><br ccID="3160">
American cheese is a type of processed cheese. It can be orange, yellow, or white in color, is mild, salty, and faintly sweet in flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a very low melting point.

Very early in its history, American cheese was only white in color—as it was made from a blend of cheeses (most often including cheddar cheese) which were originally only white. However, the later versions are often a yellow hue due to the addition of annatto, a sweet and nutty seasoning added to cheddar and to colby so that by the late 1800s American cheese was often simply called "yellow cheese."

<li ccID="4089"><b ccID="4093">Rice dishes</b><br ccID="4111">
American fried rice (Thai: ???????????????, rtgs: khao phat amerikan, pronounced [k?â(?)w p?àt ?ame?rikan]) is a Thai fried rice dish with "American" side ingredients like fried chicken, ham, hot dogs, raisins, ketchup, and croutons. Other ingredients like pineapple are optional.

<li ccID="4403"><b ccID="4407">Sandwiches</b><br ccID="4424">
A sandwich is a food item consisting of one or more types of food placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein two or more pieces of bread serve as a container or wrapper for some other food.[1][2][3] The sandwich was originally a portable food item or finger food which began its popularity primarily in the Western World, but is now found in various versions in numerous countries worldwide.

<li ccID="4855"><b ccID="4859">Sausages</b><br ccID="4874">
Breakfast sausage (or country sausage) is a type of fresh pork sausage usually served at breakfast in the United States.[1] It is a common breakfast item in traditional American "farmer" or "country" breakfasts, as it originated as a way for farmers to make use of as much of their livestock (usually pigs) as possible. Scraps and trimmings were ground, seasoned and later consumed by the farmer as an inexpensive, high-protein morning meal

DIRECTIONS
<img ccID="5519" src="red-velvet-cake_300.jpg" align="right">
<ul ccID="5570">
<li ccID="5576">Heat oven to 350° F. Butter two 8-inch round cake pans and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
<li ccID="5767">Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, vanilla, vinegar, and food coloring until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
<li ccID="5992">Reduce mixer speed to low. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions and the buttermilk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix just until combined (do not overmix).
<li ccID="6183">Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool the cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then turn out onto racks to cool completely.
<li ccID="6405">Transfer one of the cooled cakes to a plate and spread with 1 to 1½ cups of the frosting. Top with the remaining cake and spread the top and sides with the remaining frosting. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.
