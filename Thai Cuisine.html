<h1> Thai Cuisine </h1>
<br>
<p> Thai cuisin is the national cuisine of Thailand. Balance, detail, and variety are of paramount significance to Thai chefs.Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge. It is known[by whom?] for its complex interplay of at least three and up to four or five fundamental taste senses in each dish or the overall meal: sour, sweet, salty, bitter, and spicy.
<br><br>Thai cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines in the world. In 2011, seven of Thailand's popular dishes appeared on the list of the "World's 50 Most Delicious Foods (Readers' Pick)"— a worldwide online poll of 35,000 people by CNN Travel. Thailand had more dishes on the list than any other country. They were: tom yam goong (4th), pad Thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th) and moo nam tok (36th).

<h3> Laap </h3> <br> <p><font color='red'>
Thailand’s northeast in one rustic dish; laap (also known as larb or larp) takes the form of minced meat seasoned with roasted rice powder, lime juice, fish sauce and fresh herbs. Be sure to eat it with sticky rice, short, fat grains of rice that are steamed and eaten by hand.

<br><br><h3> Yam </h3>	<br><br>

 <br><br>
 As a side dish or drinking snack, you’re bound to encounter this ubiquitous Thai 'salad' that combines meat or seafood with a tart/spicy dressing and fresh herbs.  A good introduction to the genre is yam wun sen, slinky glass noodles paired with minced pork and shrimp.

  <br><br> <h3> Green Curry </h3> <br><br>
  <p> <font color='red'> For Thai food novices, there’s probably no better starting point than this intersection of a piquant/herbal spice paste and rich coconut milk. Remember to do as the Thais and couple the curry with a plate of jasmine rice – it’s not meant to be eaten on its own as a soup.
