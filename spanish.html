<font color="red" size=16>Bread and rice</font>
<p>Grain foods such as bread and rice have been eaten and enjoyed for centuries throughout Spain.

Bread is traditionally served as an accompaniment to food, often with a little extra virgin olive oil for dipping. Bread with cheese is a common snack, and bread is also used to thicken soups and stews.

The Valencia region is the home of one of Spain's most famous rice dishes, the paella. Traditionally cooked outside on an open wood fire in a large flat-bottomed pan called a paellera, a paella can include all types of ingredients including seafood, chicken, chorizo sausage, rabbit and even snails.

<font color="red" size=16>Vegetables and fruits</font>
<p>Many of the vegetables commonly used in Spanish cooking were brought back to Spain from the Americas by Spanish explorers in the 1400s and 1500s. Tomatoes, bell peppers (capsicum), potatoes and zucchini have now become synonymous not only with Spanish cuisine, but Mediterranean cuisine as a whole. Other commonly enjoyed vegetables include onions, garlic, asparagus, eggplant, spinach, cabbage, cucumbers, artichokes, lettuce and mushrooms.

These vegetables are used in rice dishes, stews such as cocida (a one pot dish with vegetables, beans and chicken or meat that originated in Madrid but is eaten throughout Spain) as well as soups such as gazpacho (a cold tomato-based soup) and a wide range of salads and vegetable side dishes.

Fruit—both fresh and dried—is enjoyed as a snack or as a dessert. Commonly enjoyed fruit include apples, oranges, grapes, cherries, dates and figs.

<font color="red" size=16>Olive and Olive oil</font>
<p>The warm, sunny climate enjoyed by much of Spain makes it ideal for olive growing. Many of these olives are pressed for their oil, and the most prized olive oil is "extra virgin," made from the first cold pressing of the best quality olives. Extra virgin olive oil is used in cooking and adds depth and texture to hot dishes when added at the end of cooking. It's also used in salad dressings and sauces and for bread dipping.

Whole olives, sometimes stuffed with anchovies or pimento (red pepper paste), are eaten as appetizers and snacks, or added to stews, hot pots and salads.

<font color="red" size=16>Legumes and nuts</font>
<p>Legumes (beans, peas and lentils) are used extensively in Spanish cooking. Chickpeas and white beans are used to make hearty bean stews and flavorsome soups. Lentils, such as Spanish pardina lentils, are also added to stews and soups and are used in salads. Green beans and peas are used in a wide range of dishes including paellas and hot pots.

Popular nuts include almonds, pine nuts and hazelnuts which are often ground down and used to thicken and enrich the flavor of stews, sauces and soups. Toasted almonds are also a popular snack.

<h2><b>Croquettes</b>
<img src="spanishmushroom.jpg" align="right">
<p>For this kind of dough of croquettes, we will not first make a bechamel roux of butter and flour, but incorporate the flour to the sautéed mushrooms, and then, little by little, we will be adding milk until getting a slightly thickened béchamel.

      We start chopping half an onion into very small pieces and we rehydrating the mushrooms, dipping about 20 minutes in warm water. After that time we will have a generous amount, equivalent to about 150 grams of fresh or frozen mushrooms.

       If using frozen mushrooms, thaw them in the refrigerator, placing them in a colander over a bowl to drain water and not left flooded. This will require thinking ahead and do that operation the day before and so we get the best results. Drain well and chop into small pieces, which are the trips that we find in each croquette.

      In a large skillet, melted butter and in it sauté the onion and mushrooms for about three or four minutes. Season and lower the heat to low and add the flour all at once. With a wooden spoon, stir to let the flour is distributed on the stir, covering every portion of onions and mushrooms, and forming a kind of sticky paste. We leave it to brown the flour stirring until dough begins to turn brown.

      Added a stream of milk and stir the slurry, allowing the liquid absorbs it, until it virtually has disappeared. We continue to add streams of milk, and letting the paste dissolves gradually, it will not take more than 15 minutes have added almost three quarters of a liter of milk or a little more, until our cakes dough is perfect and to our liking .

We add a touch of nutmeg and turn off the heat, stirring to incorporate the flavor of the spice with the intense flavor of the mushrooms in the sauce. Having done thus mass, flour has been slowly eating milk to absorb, not dissolved in it, so we will not have even a single crumb. In addition, mushrooms have been all along in the bechamel, so have brought their taste for much longer. Try it and you tell me.

      We extend the dough onto a platter and let cool and set. Finally, it only remains for us to form the kibble, this time round I did them, and fogging with beaten egg and bread crumbs. The last step is to fry the croquettes in hot olive oil, drain on absorbent paper and serve immediately.
