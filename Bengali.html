<br>
<p style="color:"#10299F"><font face='ravie'>  The cuisine of Bengal is as rich and distinct as the state itself. The rule of Nawabs has deeply influenced Bengali food which is a combination of subtle and fiery flavours. There are certain European influences also like the snack food tradition and foods like chops and cutlets that are British in origin but are prepared and served in most Bengali households.
<br> <br>
Bengali cuisine is a blend of sweet and spicy flavours. The delicate balance between the main ingredients and the seasoning plays a starring role. The simplest of meals gain an exquisite identity on adding 'phoron' or a traditional mix of pungent spices. The 'panch phoron' is used generously and it includes a combination of five spices - cumin, nigella, fenugreek, aniseed and mustard seed.
